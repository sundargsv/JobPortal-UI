Job Portal - Front end code

I have done UI and Back-end separately so as to decouple the UI and Business Code. So the people working on front end and back end can work independently. 

Please follow the GitHub Links.
1. Front end Repo :  https://github.com/sundargsv/JobPortal-UI
2. Back end Repo : https://github.com/sundargsv/JobPortal-BackEnd

Tech Stack used :
1. Job Portal UI - Angular 1.x, Bootstrap 3 and Gulp (Task Runner)
2. Job Portal (Back end) - Core Java (1.7), Spring, RESTful endpoints, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, Junit, Postman Client (Testing tools)

Follow the steps to run the UI Module :

1. First complete the Back end settup and start the server JobPortal (Back - end).
2. Install gulp task runner in your machine and download the JobPortal (UI).
3. Open terminal/ cmd, navigate to JobPortal and do the following task.
          Terminal - gulp serve
4. Once the UI application is on click on Jobs - menu to get list of jobs and to get more insights of the particular job click Apply.
